# IOT
For this project we used a LIDAR Sensor to communicate the readings it recieved to a google sheets page.  
If you are looking to follow the same code, you need to add in your own .json file generated in Kevin Lu's instructions in Chapter 7. 
In the Lidar file you need to make sure then that it calls to your Json and that you google sheet is correctly shared with the json email.
finally you need to make sure your gspread is the right version otherwise there can be errors in transmitting the code.
